 [[Interspeech 2021] End-to-End Language Diarization for Bilingual Code-switching Speech](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/pdfs/interspeech_2021/liu21d_interspeech.pdf)     

I am trying to include the data preprocessing steps in this repo so that you can reproduce the results faster. But maybe after I complete my work for interspeech 2022. Hope our wokr help your research. -- Updated 2022 Jan

  * There is no script for making data, pls do it yourself and revise the code in "data_load.py" accordingly.
  * Note that the torch.cuda.deterministics=True conflicts with conv1d with dilation and this makes the code very slow, so we set it to False in train_xsa.py. Hence we don't fix the random seed in the training stage. But if you would like to do that, that's also fine, just set it to True.
